## Installation

1. Ensure you have Minecraft 1.21.4 and Fabric Loader installed
2. Download the mod JAR file
3. Place it in your server's `mods` folder
4. Start the server to generate the config file
5. Configure your API credentials (see Configuration section)
6. Restart the server

## Configuration

The mod creates a configuration file at `config/chat-filter.json`. Key settings:

```json

}
```

### New Configuration Options

- **`debug_log_path`** - Path where detailed LLM debug logs are stored (default: `plugins/RandomDialogue/llm_debug.log`)

## Usage

### Player Commands
**Self-Management:**
- `/chatfilter enable` - Enable chat filtering for yourself
- `/chatfilter disable` - Disable chat filtering for yourself  
- `/chatfilter set <filter>` - Choose your personality filter (manual mode only)
- `/chatfilter reroll` - Get a new random filter (available in random modes)

**Information:**
- `/chatfilter status` - Check your current filter status
- `/chatfilter list` - Browse all available personality filters
- `/chatfilter llm_info` - View LLM provider and model information
- `/chatfilter who` - See everyone's current filter assignments

**Note:** Players can now manage their own filters (enable/disable/reroll) without admin permissions, while admins retain full control over server-wide settings and can manage any player's settings.

### Admin Commands
**Player Management:**
- `/chatfilter enable <player>` - Enable filtering for a specific player
- `/chatfilter disable <player>` - Disable filtering for a specific player
- `/chatfilter set <player> <filter>` - Assign a filter to a specific player
- `/chatfilter reroll <player>` - Reroll a player's filter

**Server Management:**
- `/chatfilter mode <mode>` - Change the server-wide filter mode
- `/chatfilter status [player]` - View server status or specific player details
- `/chatfilter reload` - Reload filters and configuration

**Configuration Management:**
- `/chatfilter reload_config` - Reload main configuration file
- `/chatfilter reload_all` - Reload both filter and main configuration files

**Note:** Players have full control over their own chat experience, while admins can manage server-wide settings and assist individual players.

### Configuration Validation

The mod now validates configuration on startup and will prevent server start if
critical errors are found. Use `/chatfilter reload_config` to reload and
validate configuration changes without restarting the server.

### Quote Preservation System

The mod includes intelligent quote handling:

- **Escape Transformation**: Wrap your entire message in quotes (`"like this"`) to completely bypass transformation
- **Preserve Quotes**: Quoted sections within messages are preserved exactly as written
- **Quote Recovery**: If quotes are accidentally modified, a follow-up message shows the original quoted text

Examples:
- `"This entire message bypasses transformation"` ‚Üí Sent as-is
- `I said "hello world" to everyone` ‚Üí Quotes are preserved during transformation
- If transformation accidentally changes quotes, you'll see: `<chatfilter> PlayerName: "I said..." ‚Üí ["hello world"]`

### Filter Modes

1. **MANUAL** - Players choose their own filters
2. **DAILY_RANDOM** - Random filter assigned daily
3. **SESSION_RANDOM** - Random filter assigned per login
4. **CHAOS_MODE** - Random filter for every message
5. **DISABLED** - No filtering

## Discord Integration

This plugin automatically integrates with EssentialsDiscord when available.
Transformed messages will be sent to both Minecraft chat and your configured
Discord channels.

### Setup
1. Install and configure [EssentialsDiscord](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials)
2. Ensure your Discord bot has proper permissions
3. Random Dialogue will automatically detect and use the Discord integration

### Requirements
- EssentialsDiscord plugin installed and configured
- No additional configuration needed - uses your existing EssentialsDiscord settings
- (Note: EssentialsDiscord is not a dependency, servers without EssentialsDiscord can still install RandomDialogue with no issues)

## Development

### Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Testing

```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Dependencies

- Minecraft 1.21.4
- Fabric Loader 0.16.9
- Fabric API 0.110.0+1.21.4
- Cloth Config (for configuration UI)

## API Costs and Rate Limiting

The mod includes several features to help manage API costs:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Configurable per-player rate limits
2. **Context-Aware Caching**: Responses are cached based on message content and conversation context
3. **Conversation Context**: Recent chat history improves transformation quality and reduces repeated API calls
4. **Fallback**: Original messages are sent if transformation fails
5. **Timeouts**: Configurable request timeouts prevent hanging
6. **Quote Bypass**: Fully quoted messages skip transformation entirely, saving API calls

## Debugging and Monitoring

### Debug Logging

Enable detailed LLM logging to monitor transformation quality:

```json
{
  "enable_detailed_llm_logging": true,
  "debug_log_path": "plugins/RandomDialogue/llm_debug.log"
}
```

Debug logs include:
- Full prompts sent to LLM providers
- Complete API responses
- Transformation quality analysis
- Intent preservation checking
- Quote handling verification
- Performance metrics and timing

### What Gets Logged

When debug logging is enabled, you'll see:
- **Transformation Attempts**: Player, filter, original message, and context
- **API Interactions**: Full request/response data
- **Quality Analysis**: Intent preservation and potential issues
- **Performance**: Response times and cache hit rates
- **Quote Handling**: Quote preservation success/failure details

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No valid API key"** - Check your configuration file and ensure the API key is correct
2. **"Rate limit exceeded"** - Adjust `rate_limit_per_minute` in config
3. **Messages not transforming** - Check server logs for errors, ensure API provider is accessible
4. **Quotes being modified** - Check debug logs for quote preservation issues, ensure you're using standard quote marks (`"`)
5. **Unexpected transformations** - Review conversation context in debug logs, consider if recent chat history is affecting results
6. **"Critical configuration errors detected"** - Check your config file syntax and required fields, fix errors and restart or use `/chatfilter reload_config`
7. **Configuration reload failed** - Use `/chatfilter reload_config` to test config changes before restarting

### Known Issues

- **Groq Provider**: LLM settings may cause 400 errors due to unsupported API fields
- **Memory Usage**: Conversation history accumulates on busy servers - monitor memory usage
- **Quote Handling**: Complex nested quotes may not be perfectly preserved

### Logs

The mod logs extensively to help diagnose issues:
- Configuration validation
- API request failures
- Rate limiting events
- Error metrics
- Transformation quality (when debug logging enabled)
- Quote preservation status

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory**: Conversation history is maintained per player (last 5 messages)
- **Cache**: Context-aware caching may use more memory but improves accuracy
- **API Calls**: Quote bypass and caching significantly reduce API usage
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old conversation data and cache entries
